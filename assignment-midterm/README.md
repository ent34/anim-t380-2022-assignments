# Midterm

## Description
**This project contains:**
* A python script that renames a sequence of frames in a path specified by the user with the option to zip the frames into a file that will save to that same specified path. 
* A JSON file that allows the user to configure the new naming convention of the sequence. 

## Arguments Taken
* **seqLocation:** str, Location path of the original frame sequence
* **zipFile:** bool, To Zip or Not To Zip?

## Example
Run **framerename.py seqLocation zipFile** in the command prompt. It will rename the sequence, print the renamed file name, and zip the file in the same location of the frames.
