Hi!

This script renames a file with the naming convention "vincent.rig.etaylor.1", then increments and saves the next version as an .ma file.

It takes no arguments. 

Running Example:

"D:\Program Files\Maya2020\bin\mayapy.exe" D:\ANIMT380\anim-t380-2022-assignments\assignment-4\python\versionsave.py
