Hello! This script consists of 3 different parts!

The etc folder contains the .aliases file where the environmental variable is declared as izzy.

The bin folder contains a Windows Command Prompt .bat file that creates a assets\%assets%\maya\scenes directory.

The python folder contains a script that creates an empty group with the name of the environmental variable and saves it in that same created directory as an mb file.

It takes no arguments.

Running examples:

Windows Command Prompt File:
D:\ANIMT380\anim-t380-2022-assignments\assignment-3\bin>directory-creator.bat

Python Script:
"D:\Program Files\Maya2020\bin\mayapy.exe" D:\ANIMT380\anim-t380-2022-assignments\assignment-3\python\main.py
