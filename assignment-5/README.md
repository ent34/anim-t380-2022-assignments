# Assignment 5

## Description
This script, once imported into Maya, creates a Maya Widget with a button to create a mini car and a button to create a cube.
## Arguments Taken
This script takes no arguments.
## Examples
Import the script into Maya's Script Editor and Execute.
* The 'Car' Button creates a cube with four cylinders as wheels. 
* The 'Cube' Button creates a singular cube off to the side. *(I was just testing the script here, but I left the button.)*
### Additional Notes:
I'd like to test out grouping the car geometry and naming it later with a new button.
